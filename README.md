# XMovies
This is my first app that I created on my own. It's a movie recommendation app written in SwiftUI. I used CoreData, Combine, Async/Await, MVVM, and The Movie Database API to retrieve movie data. The app consists of four screens.

The first screen is the recommendation view, where you can explore trending movies, upcoming releases, popular movies, and currently playing movies. Each movie is displayed with an icon showing its rating. By clicking on the icon, you can view detailed information about the movie, such as the overview, release date, genres, age rating, language, and overall rating. From this view, you can also save movies to your list of favorites.

The second screen is the search view, where you can search for specific movies by typing their names. The app will display a list of movies with similar names, and you can select any of them to view their details and add them to your saved movies.

The last screen is the saved movies view, which stores all the movies you have saved using CoreData. To remove a movie from your saved list, you can simply click the save button again.
